Newton's Cradle
Running the Simulation
- Adjust the mass of each ball using the buttons next to the simulation.
- The simulation will play on its own.

Known Problems
We were unable to finish coding:
- an option for the number of balls 
- user input for the initial height/angle of the ball released.
- graphs displaying changes in mechanical energy and momentum.
- the option of friction.

Newton's Cradle
The typical Newton's cradle includes five balls and demonstrates the conservation of energy and momentum. After a released ball collides with the rest of the balls, the same impact returns at the other side. That is, once the ball collides, the ball on the other end should rise at the same speed as the first ball, and will reach a similar height. With no energy loss, the number of balls that rise is always equal to the number of balls released.
